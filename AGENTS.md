# Agent Fabric — Agent Guide

Agent Fabric provides portable, provider-neutral agent definitions and adapters that compile
canonical workflows into native configurations for OpenCode, Kilo, Antigravity CLI, Codex, and Claude Code.

> **No History:** No changelogs. Reflect ONLY the current "Source of Truth".
> **Live Sync:** Keep this file updated with relevant code changes in the same commit.

> [!WARNING]
> **Avoid Redundant Documentation.** AGENTS.md is the Single Source of Truth. Do NOT create
> separate MAINTENANCE.md / ARCHITECTURE.md files that duplicate what is here. Domain
> terminology belongs in [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md); decisions in `docs/adr/`; module
> contracts in `docs/specs/`; command recipes in `docs/runbooks/`. Filing rules:

## Layout

```
agents/                  Canonical portable agent definitions (schema v1)
adapters/                Target harness adapter JSON mappings
hooks/                   Default hook templates and fallback instructions
cmd/agent-fabric/        CLI commands (install, sync, validate, doctor, hub, uninstall)
internal/agent/          Agent definition parsing, validation, and hook schema checking
internal/adapter/        Multi-harness rendering engine and format converters
internal/manifest/       Atomic state tracking (.agent-fabric-manifest.json)
docs/                    Versioned wiki (docs-organization-blueprint.md, specs/, adr/)
fixtures/                Golden test fixtures for adapter rendering
scripts/                 Release packaging and bootstrap tooling
```

## First-time setup

```bash
go test ./...
go build -o agent-fabric ./cmd/agent-fabric
```

## Daily commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `go test ./...` | Runs all unit and golden fixture tests |
| `go build ./cmd/agent-fabric` | Compiles the `agent-fabric` CLI binary |
| `scripts/release.sh <version> dist` | Builds cross-platform release archives, checksums, and manifest |

## Architecture at a glance

- **Canonical Definitions as SSOT:** Canonical agent workflows live exclusively in `agents/<id>.md` and contain full portable behavior, permissions, and declarative hook placeholders. Spec: `docs/specs/agent-fabric.md`.
- **Harness-Isolated Rendering:** Adapters (`adapters/<target>.json` + `internal/adapter/`) map abstract profiles (`planner`, `worker`, `reviewer`, `supervisor`) to harness-specific models and tool syntax without contaminating canonical bodies.
- **Deterministic Hook Resolution:** Install and sync resolve portable hooks (`load-task`, `pre-plan`, `classify`, `label`, `decompose`, `post-plan`) once from `~/.agent-hooks/`.
- **Atomic Manifest Ownership:** Project and global installs maintain `.agent-fabric-manifest.json`. Modified user files are preserved during sync unless `--force` is specified.

## Testing

- Unit tests in `internal/agent`, `internal/adapter`, `internal/manifest`, and `cmd/agent-fabric`.
- Golden fixture comparison in `internal/adapter/adapter_test.go` checks rendered output against `fixtures/`.
- Run `go test ./...` before committing.

## Secrets

Zero secrets, API keys, or provider tokens are tracked in this repository. Authentication is host-managed.

## Specs

Module and CLI behavioral contract lives in [`docs/specs/agent-fabric.md`](docs/specs/agent-fabric.md). Behavior change = update spec in the same commit as code.
